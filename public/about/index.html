        <h3>What is the GMHAN?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The Greater Manchester Homeless Action Network (GMHAN) is a network for everyone working to end homelessness in all 10 boroughs of Greater Manchester. The Network brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause.</p>
<p>We do this through large scale <strong>events</strong> every 3 months aimed at co-designing Greater Manchester&rsquo;s homelessness <strong>policy</strong> and showcasing <strong>best practice.</strong> We have three task groups which work on topics raised in between events and promote the Network&rsquo;s voice on the GM Homelessness Programme Board (which is where decisions are made).</p>
<p>The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operated on the basis of &lsquo;community development&rsquo; and co-production*, bringing people together to work side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.</p>
<p>Information flows from the Network events through the Task Groups to the Programme Board and operational teams delivering services or interventions. It also comes back the other way in a continual feedback loop.</p>

        <h3>What have we achieved?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The GMHAN was established in 2017 to achieve long-term system change so that no one need become homeless in Greater Manchester. We&rsquo;ve achieved a lot in the past 5 years, but there is a still a lot of work to be done</p>

        <h3>What are we working?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The GMHAN sets its strategic priorities once a year at the beginning of the year. The priorities are set at the full Network Events, working alongside the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to align with the political priorities and programme.</p>
<p>This year we have restructured to ensure that the work the network is doing is reflective of what is happening across Greater Manchester. We have established three task groups which will drive the strategic priorities in the future. Our priority this year is embedding this new structure and supporting the groups to get off the ground</p>

          <h3>What is the Structure?</h3>
          <p>
<p><strong>Task Groups</strong></p>
<p>The GMHAN task groups on the driving force behind the network. They focus on Learning, Lobbying &amp; Delivery. They are made up of people across the sector who have knowlegde and experience across homelessness and interconnected issues within Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Members include anyone interested in taking a more active role in the organisation of the GMHAN and in strengthening a community development approach to ending homelessness.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination Group</strong></p>
<p>The task groups are supported by a coordination group. This is a smaller group which has representatives from each sector, whose roles mean they are in a position to advocate and advise the task groups. Whilst also dealing with any immediate issues which arise.</p>
