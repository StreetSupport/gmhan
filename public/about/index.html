        <h3>What is the GMHAN?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network (GMHAN) is a network for everyone working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Network brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause.</p>

<p>We does this through large scale quarterly events aimed at co-designing Greater Manchester&rsquo;s homelessness policy and showcasing best practice. We also have an Advisory Board to work on topics raised in between events and promote the Network&rsquo;s voice on the GM Homelessness Programme Board (which is where decisions are made).</p>

<p>The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operated on the basis of &lsquo;community development&rsquo; and co-production*, bringing people together to work side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.</p>

<p>Information flows from the Network events through the Advisory Board to the Programme Board and operational teams delivering services or interventions. It also comes back the other way in a continual feedback loop.</p>

        <h3>What have we achieved so far?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The HAN has been established to achieve long-term systems change so that no one need become homeless in Greater Manchester. We&rsquo;re not looking for quick fixes. Examples of what the HAN has been involved in since starting in 2017 include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Co-produced a <a href="link to resources" target="_blank">Rough Sleeping Strategy</a> for the city</li>
<li>Taking the decision to deliver the Bed Every Night emergency shelter scheme, which has halved rough sleeping in Greater Manchester.</li>
<li>Raising the question of family homelessness to the Programme Board Chaired by the Mayor Andy Burnham to change the approach to how families are supported in temporary accommodation</li>
<li>Shining the spotlight on youth homelessness, resulting in the development of a second Social Impact Bond programme focused on this issue</li>
<li>Supporting the evolution of a community night shelter in a local borough into a formal commissioned partner of the Bed Every Night programme</li>
<li>Informed the national asks made by the Mayor of Greater Manchester to parties during the 2019 General Election</li>
</ul></p>

        <h3>What are we working on this year?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The HAN sets its strategic priorities once a year at the beginning of the year. The priorities are set at the full Network Events, working alongside the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to align with the political priorities and programme.</p>

<p>Priorities for 2020 will be established at the full GMHAN Event on 3rd March - watch this space!</p>

          <h3>How the Advisory Board works</h3>
          <p>
<p>The GMHAN Advisory Board is a core group of people who have experience across homelessness and interconnected issues within Greater Manchester.</p>

<p>Members are anyone interested in taking a more active role in the organisation of the GMHAN and in strengthening a community development approach to ending homelessness.</p>

<p>Members are &lsquo;brokers&rsquo; in their areas of work, acting as bridges into their sector to ensure there is an exchange of information and knowledge from the ground up and vice versa. They currently include voluntary sector partnership managers, Combined Authority officers, faith leaders, university researchers, co-production experts and housing provider representatives. The ambition is for this membership to expand to fill gaps in all specialisms and geographical areas.</p>

<p>The Terms of Reference for the Board are available <strong><a href="link resources page Terms of Reference doc" target="_blank">here</a>:</strong></p>

<p>The Advisory Board has two components which reflect its dual functions of action:</p>

<p>-The Advisory Board has fortnightly &lsquo;Action Sessions&rsquo; alongside more formal &lsquo;Accountability Meetings&rsquo; for making decisions &ldquo;Advisory Board components&rdquo;</p>

And more.</p>
