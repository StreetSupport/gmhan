        <h3>What is the GMFSAN?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The Greater Manchester Food Security Action Network (GMFSAN) is a network for everyone working to end food insecurity in Greater Manchester. The Network brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause.</p>
<p>We do this through our larger scale network events every 3 months aimed at co-designing Greater Manchester’s food security policy and showcasing best practice. We have three smaller task force groups that work on the priorities raised by the wider network; Increasing the uptake of Healthy Start Vouchers, Ending Holiday Hunger and Doing More For Those Who Miss Out On Support. The work of these three task force groups is organised by the GMFSAN Core Coordination Group, a small group comprising the chairs of the three task forces, GMCA Policy Officers and our GMFSAN Chair.</p>
<p>The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operated on the basis of ‘community development’ and co-production*, bringing people together to work side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.</p>

        <h3>What have we achieved so far?</h3>
        <p>
<p>The Food Security Action Network (FSAN) is a group of stakeholders across Greater Manchester working collaboratively with the aim of ending food poverty in the city-region. The launch of the FSAN occurred in October 2021 with around 70 individuals joining from the GMCA, Local Authorities, GM Businesses, the faith sector, the VCSE sector, Health and Education. Following the launch 3 task force groups have been formed to focus on action in the areas of Holiday Hunger, Increasing the uptake of Healthy Start Vouchers and Doing more for those who miss out.</p>
