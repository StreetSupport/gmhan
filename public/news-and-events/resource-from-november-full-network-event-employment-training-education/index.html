<p>Thanks again to everyone who attended the GMHAN &amp; GMCA full Network Event: How do we improve Employment, Training &amp; Education support for people who have experienced Homelessness? It was great to see so many of you there</p>
<p>The day started with presentations on The Cost of Living Crisis- The Impact on Employment, Training &amp; Education from GMPA and Employment, Training &amp; Education as Homelessness Preventionfrom GMCA. You can check out the slides from all presentations <a href="https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/ete-event-slides.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>We asked attendees to share knowledge around what Employment, Training and Education provisions are available and what gaps there are in services across Greater Manchester- You told us <a href="https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/what-support-is-available.docx">What you thought was available</a> and <a href="https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/what-support-is-missing.pdf">What you thought was missing</a></p>
