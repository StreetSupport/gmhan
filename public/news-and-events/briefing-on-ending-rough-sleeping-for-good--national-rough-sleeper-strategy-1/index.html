      <img class="event-page-image" src="/assets/uploads/ending-rough-sleeping.png" alt="">
      <p>
<p>On Saturday 5th September the Department for Levelling Up, Housing &amp; Communities published an update to the Rough Sleeping Strategy, titled &lsquo;Ending Rough Sleeping for Good&rsquo;. this was driven by the Minister for Rough Sleeping, Eddie Hughes MP. You can read the full strategy <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1102408/20220903_Ending_rough_sleeping_for_good.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>Greater Manchester Combined Authority have been part of the Minister&rsquo;s Advisory Panel working on this for the last 18 months, and have put together this briefing to help us understand the changes and opportunities it presents.</p>
<p><strong>Briefing on ‘Ending Rough Sleeping for Good’ – National Rough Sleeper Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Strategy update driven by the growing lobbying following Covid-19 Response, in particular the Kerslake Commission, and the opportunity from 3 year Spending Review settlement</p>
<p>Ministerial Advisory Panel formed to provide sounding board and gather recommendations </p>
<p>Nearly all policies and related funding are already known and most already allocated (with some under embargo up until this point – RSI, Housing First, RSAP)</p>
<p>Announcement of co-developed national rough sleeper data framework with Centre for Homelessness Impact</p>
<p>New funded policy announced within the strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Homelessness Accommodation Programme </li>
<li>Test and Learn Programme</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive cross-departmental ownership of the strategy</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>We will commit to working with stakeholders from local authorities and the service delivery sector to establish an operational risk assessment tool to assist with prevention of rough sleeping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will support our ambition that no-one is released from a public institution to the streets through the following commitments:</p>
