<p>The GMHAN Learning Group launched their new ‘learning cycle’ on Tuesday 18th April, with an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/what-is-good-support-for-meaningful-lived-experience-involvement-tickets-596731117837">online Open Space</a>, open to GMHAN partners. This workshop was developed and facilitated as a collaboration between the Learning Group and the GM Jokers, aiming to explore how we could bring action learning to life, and do meetings differently!</p>
<p>The focus of this new learning cycle is to explore the question ‘<strong>What does good support look like for lived experience involvement and coproduction?</strong>’ The aim is to create space for honest reflection on how the sector does co-production, and to think about the needs and wants of people who are involved and asked to bring their own personal stories and experiences into system design work.</p>
<p>In the session we focused on the feelings and emotions arising from coproduction, using verbal and non-verbal responses to capture participant feedback. The learning has then been developing into poems, rather than meeting minutes, to enable people to engage with the learning outcomes differently. You can <a href="https://www.gmhan.net/assets/uploads/combinepdf.pdf">read these poems here</a>, and they will be used as tools to explore our questions further</p>
<p>Over the next 3 months, the learning group will be looking to hold a wide variety of learning events, in different localities, at different times and with different approaches, to change the way we deliver meetings, to improve accessibility of events and outcomes.</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved with the Learning group, you can:</p>
<p>1.       Write your own poem about lived experience involvement and submit it to us</p>
<p>2.       Come to one of our future learning events, participate and share your experiences</p>
<p>3.       Join the learning group by emailing <a href="mailto:info@gmhan.net">info@gmhan.net</a> and express your interest to get involved</p>
<p>4.       Share our learning with others and encourage others to join our learning project</p>
