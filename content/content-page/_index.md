    causes within Greater Manchester.

    Local community and charitable organisations are the frontline of our
    response to homelessness. Their staff and volunteers work tirelessly, and a
    donation to them can make a huge difference to what they are able to
    achieve.

    Get behind a city-wide campaign which is honing in on a specific homeless
    challenge in our city.




    Right now, the big effort GM partners are putting in is the provision of
    emergency night shelters as a first step off the streets (and so no one
    sleeps out in the cold).
