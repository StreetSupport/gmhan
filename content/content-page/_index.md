    Giving money is one of the simplest and most effective ways you can make a
    difference to homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Homeless Action
    Network itself has no costs, so weâ€™d encourage people to give to other
    causes within Greater Manchester.

    Get behind a city-wide campaign which is honing in on a specific homeless
    challenge in our city.
    Right now, the big effort GM partners are putting in is the provision of
    emergency night shelters as a first step off the streets (and so no one
    sleeps out in the cold)
    Find out more about A Bed Every Night and join others such as Vincent
    Kompany and the Mayor of Greater Manchester by donating
