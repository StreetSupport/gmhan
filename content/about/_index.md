whatIs:
  body: >-
    The Greater Manchester Homelessness Action Network (GMHAN) is a network for
    everyone working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Network
    brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this
    ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause. 


    We does this through large scale **quarterly events** aimed at co-designing
    Greater Manchester's homelessness **policy** and showcasing **best
    practice.** We also have an Advisory Board to work on topics raised in
    between events and promote the Network's voice on the GM Homelessness
    Programme Board (where final decisions are made).


    The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater
    Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operates on the basis of
    'community development' and co-production, bringing people together to work
    side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.


    Information flows from the Network events through the Advisory Board to the
    Programme Board and operational teams delivering services or interventions.
    It also comes back the other way in a continual feedback loop.

  heading: What is the GMHAN?
howWorks:
  body: >-
    The GMHAN Advisory Board is a core group of people who have experience
    across homelessness and interconnected issues within Greater Manchester.


    Members are anyone interested in taking a more active role in the
    organisation of the GMHAN and in strengthening a community development
    approach to ending homelessness.


    Members are 'brokers' in their areas of work, acting as bridges into their
    sector to ensure there is an exchange of information and knowledge from the
    ground up and vice versa. They currently include voluntary sector
    partnership managers, Combined Authority officers, faith leaders, university
    researchers, co-production experts and housing provider representatives. The
    ambition is for this membership to expand to fill gaps in all specialisms
    and geographical areas.


    The Terms of Reference for the Board are available **[here](<link resources
    page Terms of Reference doc>):**


    The Advisory Board has two components which reflect its dual functions of
    action:


    \- Fortnightly 'Action Sessions' alongside 


    \- More formal 'Accountability Meetings' for making decisions
  heading: About the Advisory Board
whatHave:
  body: >-
    The HAN has been established to achieve long-term systems change so that no
    one need become homeless in Greater Manchester. We're not looking for quick
    fixes. Examples of what the HAN has been involved in since starting in 2017
    include:


    * Co-produced a [Rough Sleeping Strategy](<link to resources>) for the city

    * Made the decision to deliver the **Bed Every Night** **emergency shelter
    scheme**, which has halved rough sleeping in Greater Manchester.

    * Secured funding for **new pilots into family homelessness** by raising the
    question of how families are supported in temporary accommodation

    * Shining the spotlight on youth homelessness, resulting in the development
    of a **Youth Homelessness Social Impact Bond** programme focused on this
    issue

    * Supporting the evolution of a **community partnership project** in a local
    borough to work alongside and secure funding from the local authority

    * Informed the **national asks** made by the Mayor of Greater Manchester to
    parties during the 2019 General Election
  heading: What have we achieved so far?
whoIs:
  body: >-
    The HAN is anyone who wants to end homelessness. So far, this has included
    people from Greater Manchester’s voluntary and community sector, housing
    providers, people who have been or are homeless, universities, health, faith
    communities, local and regional government, cultural spaces, researchers,
    activists and politicians. And more.


    We are constantly working to develop the network and its members so this is
    not a finite list, if you would like to be involved in the network, either
    by attending events or in the Advisory Board, you can find out more

    The HAN sets its strategic priorities once a year at the beginning of the
    year. The priorities are set at the full Network Events, working alongside
    the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to align with the political
    priorities and programme.
