  heading: About The GMHAN
whatIs:
  body: >-
    The Greater Manchester Homeless Action Network (GMHAN) is a network for
    everyone working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester. The Network
    brings together all the different sectors and specialisms involved in this
    ambition, so we can work together towards a common cause. 


    We do this through large scale **events** every 3 months aimed at
    co-designing Greater Manchester's homelessness **policy** and showcasing
    **best practice.** We also have an Advisory Board to work on topics raised
    in between events and promote the Network's voice on the GM Homelessness
    Programme Board (which is where decisions are made). 


    The Network is cross sector, including representatives from all ten Greater
    Manchester boroughs. Most importantly, it operated on the basis of
    'community development' and co-production*, bringing people together to work
    side by side rather than alone or in hierarchies.


    Information flows from the Network events through the Advisory Board to the
    Programme Board and operational teams delivering services or interventions.
    It also comes back the other way in a continual feedback loop. 
  heading: What is the GMHAN?
howWorks:
  body: >-
    The GMHAN Advisory Board is a core group of people who have experience
    across homelessness and interconnected issues within Greater Manchester.


    Members include anyone interested in taking a more active role in the
    organisation of the GMHAN and in strengthening a community development
    approach to ending homelessness.


    Members are 'brokers' in their areas of work, acting as bridges into their
    sector to ensure there is an exchange of information and knowledge from the
    ground up and vice versa. They currently include voluntary sector
    partnership managers, Combined Authority officers, faith leaders, university
    researchers, co-production experts and housing provider representatives. The
    ambition is for this membership to expand to fill gaps in all specialisms
    and geographical areas.


    The Terms of Reference for the Advisory Board is available
    **[here](https://gmhan.netlify.com/assets/uploads/gmhan-advisory-board-terms-of-reference.pdf).**


    The Advisory Board has two components which reflect its dual functions of
    action:

    The HAN has been established to achieve long-term systems change so that no
    one need become homeless in Greater Manchester. We're not looking for quick
    fixes. Examples of what the HAN has been involved in since starting in 2017
    include:


    * Co-producing a **[Rough Sleeping Action
    Plan](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/media/1234/homeless-action-network-strategy.pdf)**
    for the city.

    * Taking the decision to deliver the **Bed Every Night emergency shelter
    scheme**, which has halved rough sleeping in Greater Manchester.

    * Securing funding for a **homeless families scheme** by highlighting the
    issue with Mayor Andy Burnham and the GM Programme Board.

    * Shining the spotlight on youth homelessness, resulting in the development
    of a **Youth Homelessness Social Impact Bond** programme focused on this
    issue.

    * Supporting the evolution of a **community partnership** within a a local
    borough to work alongside and receive funding from the Local Authority.

    * Informed the **national political asks** made by the Mayor of Greater
    Manchester to parties during the 2019 General Election
  heading: What have we achieved so far?
