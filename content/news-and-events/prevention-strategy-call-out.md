    The GMHAN is recruiting 5 community members interested in arts and activism,
    policy change and leadership to work with Legislative Theatre tools towards
    the Greater Manchester Homelessness Prevention Strategy in 2020. The
    trainees will work closely with legislative theatre facilitator Katy Rubin,
    and will help lead workshops, dialogues and performances throughout GM. 


    This opportunity is specifically for people with personal experience of
    homelessness. No arts or facilitation experience necessary, but it does
    require a strong interest in both, and availability for 10-15 hours/month
    from April - Dec 2020. All training and practice time will be paid at
    **Â£10/hour**; travel expenses will also be covered. 


    NOTE: training will start in April and will take place over video until we
    are able to meet in person. This opportunity requires the ability to join
    video calls by computer or phone; there may be assistance available for
    equipment or data.


    To apply, please send Katy Rubin a few sentences about why you are
    interested, to [katyrw@gmail.com](mailto:katyrw@gmail.com), by Fri 3rd
    April. This may be followed up by a short phone call. We are recruiting a
    cohort diverse in age, gender, locality, etc; in addition to this
    opportunity, there will be other paid opportunities to use theatre within
    the GMHAN this year!
