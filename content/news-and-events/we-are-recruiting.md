    The GMHAN is now looking for a new Network Manager to bring together these our partners to work to drive action and make a difference.

Since this role was initially bought in, the network structure and funding as strengthened, however we are now looking for someone to play a key role in further developing the GMHAN’s strategic role across the region. This includes facilitating full network events, supporting systems change through our network task groups, driving the work of the coordination group and bringing new partners into the network. This role will have some involvement in new funding applications for additional roles and will be the line manager for the network’s Lived Experience Co-ordinator post.


    If you are interested in delivering coproduction, bringing people together and driving change, then this is a great opportunity to build on your knowledge and develop your skills.


    This is a 12-month contract with the potential for extension, and is available as a secondment or fixed term contract.


    We particularly welcome candidates with lived experience of homelessness, however this is not essential for the role.
