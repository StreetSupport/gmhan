  heading: GMHAN Full Network Meeting to explore GM response to Covid-19
  body: >-
    The HAN was due to meet as a whole network event on Wednesday 20th May, due
    to current restrictions we will be hosting the event in two separate Zoom
    meetings, we hope this will allow for most people’s diaries and the maximum
    number of people to attend.


    The meeting will focus on planning for the future, both living with Covid and looking to a society without the disease present. As the GMHAN we believe that whilst coronavirus has wrought great damage, we can also use this next phase to end homelessness for good. This May’s HAN will give us an opportunity to start determining what this could look like as a collection of different sectors, viewpoints and ideas.


    We will also be joined by Mayor of GM Andy Burnham and Mayor of Salford Paul Dennett to share updates on the Covid response so far.


    A full agenda with some brief recommended reading will be published in advance on the [Resources](gmhan.net/resources) page.
