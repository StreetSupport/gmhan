    If you have lived experience of homelessness, or are involved with a project
    working to end homelessness in Greater Manchester, then we want you to be a
    part of the Network. 


    How you want to be involved is up to you:


    * Sign up to the [Mailing
    List](https://streetsupport.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=da9a1d4bb2b1a69a981456972&id=3c6ae13085)
    to hear about new events and activities

    * Attend the wider network events every three months. These usually take
    place at Salford University and will be advertised through the mailing list
    and on the [News And Events](/news-and-events) page.

    * Let us know about good practice in ending homelessness that you are
    involved in, or a problem you've spotted that you don't think is being
    addressed by contacting email@gmhan.net 

    * Volunteer to be part of the Advisory Board 'Action Meetings' focused on
    delivering this year's key priorities (see [here](<link to About section on
    vision>))

    * Volunteer to be the link person for your borough or field of work. To see
    which areas we're looking for representatives from, follow [this link](<link
    to About members bit>)


    ## Other ways to get involved


    Not everyone can get involved in everything, and that's fine. If you live,
    work or visit Greater Manchester and are concerned about rising homelessness
    around you, you may prefer to:


    1. **Give money**: find out more about the best ways you can donate to
    ending homelessness on our [Giving page](/give)

    2. **Give time or items**: go to key GMHAN member [Street
    Support](streetsupport.net) to see what volunteering opportunities or need
    for items there are in your area

    Homelessness and shortage of housing supply are political issues, meaning we
    need a political response as well as the excellent work on the ground across
    Greater Manchester, to come close to ending homelessness. **Everyone's**
    voice counts in raising these issues with decision makers. So what can you
    do and who can you speak to?


    Various levels of government have responsibility for homelessness:


    * National Government oversees overall budget for local authorities,
    regulations around house building, housing benefits rates and policies on
    welfare, employment, the private rented sector and legal aid, changes to
    which can result in someone becoming threatened with homelessness.

    * Local Authorities have a legal ‘Duty of Care’ to “take reasonable steps to
    help prevent any eligible person (regardless of priority need status,
    intentionality and whether they have a local connection) who is threatened
    with homelessness from becoming homeless”. 

      As of 2010, this does not include people with no recourse to public funds (people seeking asylum or those who came to the UK from outside of the European Economic Area). Local councils also have responsibility for local homelessness budgets, setting spending priorities for temporary housing, mental health support and outreach services as well as funding for local homelessness support charities.
    * Regional Government (in areas with Combined Authorities like Greater
    Manchester), have limited responsibility for homelessness, but their elected
    Mayors have taken a political responsibility for making sure the issues
    surrounding homelessness are focused on locally. For the first time,
    Combined Authorities have been given funds from Central Government to run
    programmes across their city regions, such as in GM for Housing First,
    Social Impact Bonds and night shelters helping people move off the streets
    into stable accommodation.


    You can contact your elected representatives, across all levels of
    government, to ensure they are keeping housing and the issues surrounding
    homelessness at the top of their political agenda. You can use our
    '[priorities for action](<link to resources>)'  as a guide or just tell them
    how you feel about homelessness and your experiences of being unhoused in
    their area.
