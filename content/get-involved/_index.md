    Real Change is a partnership between everyone who wants to end homelessness
    in Oldham. That's because we know we'll struggle to do it alone, but
    together we **can** make a difference. If like us you believe that no one
    should be homeless or beg on our streets, then come and get involved.


    Whether you're interested in getting involved personally, on behalf of your
    community group, workplace or college, or as a business, there are many ways

    
    you can help. Get in touch by emailing
    [info@realchangeoldham.co.uk](mailto://realchangeoldham@gmail.com) with any
    inquiries.


    As well as donating directly to the fund, you might want to:
